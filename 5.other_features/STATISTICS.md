# Statistics

## Query Service
We can write a log in the query services, this includes
 - user
 - active url
 - errors
 - and so on

 So It can be consumed via logging statistics platform such as 
 - SPLUNK
 - ELK

And after the framework consumed the logs we can diagnosis the useage of user or each pages easily.
